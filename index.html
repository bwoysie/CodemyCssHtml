      <span class="first-letter">I</span> am in Negril Jamaica for what is described as the best sunset in the World.
       I will not argue with that as the view is spectacular.
       I’m sure you’ve seen a sunset. But have you ever experienced watching the sun set at one the best locations in the world?
       While warm tropical breezes engulf you? While songs from the legendary Bob Marley play live filling your ear with sweet melodies?
       We didn’t think so.Rick’s Café is known for having an unrivalled view of the sunset in Jamaica. Set in the West End atop a 35-foot
       high cliff, it is also known for a heart-throbbing, exhilarating cliff jumping!.The cliff side was originally owned by a local doctor
       who was the son of the first Governor-General of the newly independent Jamaica.  However, Rick’s Cafe wasn’t founded until 1974
       by Richard Hershman.At this time Negril was a sleepy fishing village with  few establishments, electricity,  telephone or running 
       water It was however, always known for the wonderful SevenMile Beach. Rick’s Cafe added another breath-taking attraction and
       became the first public bar and restaurant in the area that possessed such a magnificent view of the sunset.

      It started eight days ago when I arrived in Malilla on the boat from Malaga. The sun hit me like a judgement as I stepped onto the gangplank. A bit about Morocco:

      Jamaica has a population of over 3.8 million and an area of 446,550 km2 (172,410 sq mi). Its capital is Kingston, and the largest city is Montego Bay. Other major cities include Ocho Rios, Portmore, Negril, Treaure Beach, Morant Bay, Mandeville, Meknes, Oujda, Kenitra, and Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours.

      Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and Northwestern Africa. Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North-African country to avoid Ottoman occupation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was be divided into a French and Spanish protectorates, with an international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.

      Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.

      Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of the Constitutional court.

      Morocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Tamazight. Moroccan dialect, referred to as Darija, and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is an influential member of the Arab League and a part of the Union for the Mediterranean. It has the fifth largest economy of Africa.
